## Results summary

* The model demonstrates a **7% improvement** over the baseline heuristic algorithm
* This translates to over **$4 000 000 in savings** on the initiative's implementation budget
* After analyzing budget-performance sensitivity, **$60 000 000 is an optimal budget** is revealed as the optimal budget that maximizes overall profit
