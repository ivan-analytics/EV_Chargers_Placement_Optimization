## Results summary

* The model demonstrates **7% improvement** over the baseline heuristic algorithm
* This translates to over **$4 000 000 of savings** on the budget required for the initiative implementation
* After iterating the model over different budget amounts and looking at budget vs. performance sensitivity, **$60 000 000 is an optimal budget** that maximizes overall profit
